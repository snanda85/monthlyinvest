            <title>Basics of Investing</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;The habit of investment cannot be the result of an impulsive decision, but rather a gradual change in the mindset.
Although investing a lumpsum amount is not bad, it is actually the regular savings that helps in accumulating wealth over time.
Slowly and steadily, regular investing becomes a habit that can reward you in future. It provides the discipline to allocate money for saving before you have the temptation to spend it. &lt;/p&gt;
