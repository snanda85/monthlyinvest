MonthlyInvest.com is an initiative by like-minded people to explain the advantage of regular investing in order to achieve oneâ€™s financial goals. Our primary aim is to provide retail investors with enough information about various investment instruments including Bank Deposits, Equities, Debt etc., so they can make informed decisions about their investments.

Usually, a salaried person contributes a particular amount every month towards his savings but a substantial percentage of salaried people do not understand the importance of defining allocation strategies. So they either pump all the money into a single instrument or in same segment.  

To resolve this, **we will publish an article every month describing the allocation of monthly funds**, after taking in consideration various driving factors like country's economy, sentiments, recession, bank interst rates, gold price, stock market fluctuation etc.

This website is not only about providing multibagger stock tips, but also **for people who prefer fixed deposits more than stock market**. We give equal importance to low and high risk takers. For this purpose, the content is divided into four series:

Gyan
: General articles about investing will be shared here

Low Risk
: Investments with primary focus on defensive and debt based instruments like Bank deposits, PPF etc.

Medium Risk
: Investments with equal focus on large-cap (safer) equity and debt based instruments

High Risk
: Investments with weighted focus towards equity

Details of each strategy can be found at our [investment strategies][] page.
