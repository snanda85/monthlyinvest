There are multiple options of monthly investments. However, we will pick only a certain subset of instruments to invest regularly. Below are the various available options:

Fixed Income intruments
: These instruments carry the minimum risks and assure the stable income to investors. These are further divided into two categories:

- Tax saving:  PPF, 5yr FD
- Non tax saving:  FD, RD

Bullion market
: Bullion investments may be used as a hedge against inflation, deflation or currency devaluation. We will focus only on Gold and that too in ETFs (Exchange traded funds). Some may call it paper gold.

Equity Stocks
: An equity investment generally refers to the buying and holding of shares of stock on a stock market by individuals and firms in anticipation of income from dividends and capital gains, as the value of the stock rises. Stocks of companies are of three types:

- Large Cap Stocks: Stocks of companies with market capitalization of more than ₹10,000 crores are called large-cap stocks. One can look at the BSE-Sensex or BSE-100 Index as a reference point for large cap stocks. These are stocks of usually large and well-established companies that have a strong market presence and are generally considered as _safe investments_. Example: TCS, ONGC, ITC etc.
- Mid Cap Stocks: Mid cap stocks are those that generally have a market capitalisation within the range of ₹1,500 crores to ₹10,000 crores. These represent mid-sized companies that are relatively more risky than large cap as investment options yet, they are not considered as risky as small cap companies.  Example: Mindtree, Suven Life sciences etc.
- Small Cap Stocks: Small cap stocks are those that generally have a market capitalisation less than ₹1,500 crores. Example: Polyplex corporation, NIIT etc.

Note: Market capitalization is the aggregate valuation of the company based on its current share price and the total number of outstanding stocks.

Mutual Funds
: An investment vehicle that is made up of a pool of funds collected from many investors for the purpose of investing in securities such as stocks, bonds, money market instruments and similar assets. Mutual funds are operated by fund managers, who invest the fund's capital and attempt to produce capital gains and income for the investors. Some of the categories of mutual funds based on Investment objective are:

- Equity/Growth fund: These funds focus their investments towards equities/stocks
- Fixed Income fund: These funds invest in govt and corporate bonds
- Money Market fund: These funds invest in short term fixed income securities like treasury bills.
- Balanced/Hybrid fund: These funds invest in mix of equities and fixed income securities.

At MonthlyInvest, we will focus mainly on Equity (Growth) funds. Futher, we will invest in the following categories of Equity funds:

- Large Cap funds: These funds invest mostly in large caps stocks and are relatively safer
- Small/Mid cap funds: These funds invest mostly in small/mid caps stocks. These are a little riskier but generate better returns.
- Sector funds: These funds invest in companies of specific sectors. We will invest in defensive sectors for hedging.
