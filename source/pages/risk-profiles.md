title: Calculate your risk profile
permalink: /risk-profiles/

We have divided investments into three categories: Low Risk, Medium Risk, High Risk. The risk profile of an individual depends on many factors. A whole book can be written on this topic alone, so discussing all the factors will be out of scope of this page.

We have devised a simple formula to calculate your risk profile, which takes in account the below factors:

Loans (Home/Vehicle/Others)
: A person should have low risk profile if the amount of family income spent in repaying the loan is equal to or greater than 35% of total. Similarly, if the percentage is between 25-35%, then the person should have medium risk profile. If less than 25% is spent on paying the loan, then the person can afford to have high risk profile.

Years of service left
: There is a direct relationship between number of years left in the service and the risk capability. Lesser the number of years, lesser the ability to take risk. We recommended a person to maintain low risk profile if number of years left in service is between 0-10. If the number of years left in service is between 10-20, then one can have medium risk profile. Similarly, if the number of years left in service is more than 20, then one can have high risk investments.

Monthly expenses
: A person whose more than 35% of total family income is spent on monthly expenses, it is recommended for the person to maintain low risk profile. If 25-35% of total family income is spent on monthly expenses, then person can have medium risk profile. If less than 25% is spent on monthly expenses, then person has the ability to have high risk profile.

The Magic Formula
-----------------
This formula will give just a rough idea of a person's risk tolerance. A person may choose to follow or discard it as per his or her own choice.
