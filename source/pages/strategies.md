The purpose is to invest a particular amount every month for long term wealth creation. As a baseline, our allocation funds will be ₹10,000 per month. You can choose to invest any factor of this amount depending on your monthly income, like ₹2k, ₹5k, ₹20k etc. We will also review the value and strategy of the investments at the end of every quarter.

Assumptions
-----------
The following assumptions about annual returns are made by taking into consideration the returns given by Equities/Mutual Funds in last 10-15 years.

Debt (Fixed Income interments)
: Average return of 8-10% can be expected from debt/fixed income instruments.

Equity Mutual Funds
: These can be further divided into 2 categories:

- Large Cap Equity Mutual funds: Average return of 13-17% can be expected from this fund category.
- Small/Mid Cap Equity Mutual funds: Average return of 18-22% can be expected from this fund category.

Equity Stocks
: These can be further divided into 2 categories:

- Large Cap stocks: Average return of 18-22% can be expected from this category.
- Small/Mid Cap stocks: Average return of 25-30% can be expected from this category.

Gold ETF
: Average return of 5% cab be expected from this category.

_Note_: The stock selection is also equally important for good returns. You cannot just invest in any small/mid cap and expect 25-30% return. It requires careful study of the company profile as well.

Strategies & Returns
--------------------
Below are the strategies that we will follow for different risk profiles, along with the returns that we expect:

### Low Risk
60% of capital will be allocated in Fixed income instruments, 25% in Equity mutual funds, 10% in Equity stocks and 5% in Gold ETF's.

_Expected Return = (.60 x 9) + (.25 x 13) + (.10 x 19) + (.05 x 5) = 10.80%_  
**≈11%**


### Medium Risk
40% of capital will be allocated in Fixed income instruments, 25% in Equity mutual funds, 30% in Equity stocks and 5% in Gold ETF's.

_Expected Return = (.40 x 9) + (.25 x 15) + (.30 x 21) + (.05 x 5) = 13.90%_  
**≈14%**


### High Risk
20% of capital will be allocated in Fixed income instruments, 25% in Equity mutual funds, 50% in Equity stocks and 5% in Gold ETF’s

_Expected Return: (.20 x 9) + (.25 x 20) + (.50 x 28) + (.05 x 5) = 21.05%_   
**≈22%**
