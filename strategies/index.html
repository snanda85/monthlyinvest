<p>Divide 10000rs monthly for wealth creation</p>

<h2 id="categories-of-investment">Categories of investment</h2>
<p>There are multiple options of monthly investments. However, we will pick only a certain subset of instruments to invest regularly. Below are the various available options:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Fixed Income intruments</dt>
  <dd>These instruments carries the minimum risks and assure the stable income to investors. These are further divided into two categories:</dd>
</dl>

<ul>
  <li>Tax saving :  PPF, FD etc</li>
  <li>Non tax saving:  FD, RD etc</li>
</ul>

<dl>
  <dt>Bullion market</dt>
  <dd>Bullion investments may be used as a hedge against inflation, deflation or currency devaluation. We will focus only on Gold and that too in ETFs (Exchange traded funds)</dd>
  <dt>Equities Investments</dt>
  <dd>An equity investment generally refers to the buying and holding of shares of stock on a stock market by individuals and firms in anticipation of income from dividends and capital gains, as the value of the stock rises. Stocks of companies are of three types:</dd>
</dl>

<ul>
  <li>Large Cap Stocks: One can look at the BSE-Sensex or BSE-100 Index as a reference point for large cap stocks. Market capitalisation for  large cap stocks are more than 10000 crores. These are stocks of usually large and well-established companies that have a strong market presence and are generally considered as safe investments. Example : TCS, ONGC, ITC etc.</li>
  <li>Mid Cap Stocks:  Mid cap stocks are those that generally have a market capitalisation within the range of 1500 crores to 10000 crores .These represent mid-sized companies that are relatively more risky than large cap as investment options yet, they are not considered as risky as small cap companies.  Example: Mindtree, Suven Life sciences etc.</li>
  <li>Small Cap Stocks: Small cap stocks are those that generally have a market capitalisation less than Rs 1500 crores . Example : Polyplex corporation, NIIT etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: Market capitalization is the aggregate valuation of the company based on its current share price and the total number of outstanding stocks.</p>

<p>2) Mutual Funds:  An investment vehicle that is made up of a pool of funds collected from many investors for the purpose of investing in securities such as stocks, bonds, money market instruments and similar assets.Mutual funds are operated by money managers, who invest the fund’s capital and attempt to produce capital gains and income for the fund’s investors. There are following categories of mutual funds based on Investment objective:</p>

<p>Type of Fund        :</p>

<p>Equity/Growth fund : These funds invest mostly in equities</p>

<p>Fixed Income fund: These funds invest in govt and corporate bonds</p>

<p>Money Market fund: These funds invest in short term fixed income securities like treasury bills.</p>

<p>Balanced fund: These funds invest in mix of equities and fixed income securities.</p>

<p>Here we will focus mainly on Equity / Growth funds. Now there are following categories of Equity funds:</p>

<p>-&gt; Large Cap funds  : These funds invest mostly in large caps stocks.</p>

<p>-&gt; Small/Mid cap funds: These funds invest mostly in small/mid caps stocks.</p>

<p>-&gt; Sector funds: These funds invest in companies of specific sectors.</p>

<p>Equity Stocks
Equity Mutual Funds
Debt: Fixed (PPF, Bank Deposits FD/RD/NSC/KVP, Debt Mutual Funds, Govt Bonds)
Bullion: Gold, Silver (ETFs)</p>

<h2 id="return-assumptions">Return Assumptions</h2>
<p>These following assumptions about annual returns are made by taking into consideration the returns given by Equities/Mutual Funds in last 10-15 years.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Debt (Fixed Income interments)</dt>
  <dd>Average return of 8-10% can be expected from debt/fixed income instruments.</dd>
  <dt>Equity Mutual Funds</dt>
  <dd>These can be further divided into 2 categories:</dd>
</dl>

<ul>
  <li>Large Cap Equity Mutual funds : Average return of 13-17% can be expected from this fund category.</li>
  <li>Small/Mid Cap Equity Mutual funds : Average return of 18-22% can be expected from this fund category.</li>
</ul>

<dl>
  <dt>Equity Stocks</dt>
  <dd>These can be further divided into 2 categories:</dd>
</dl>

<ul>
  <li>Large Cap stocks : Average return of 18-22% can be expected from this category.</li>
  <li>Small/Mid Cap stocks : Average return of 25-30% can be expected from this category.</li>
</ul>

<dl>
  <dt>Gold ETF</dt>
  <dd>Average return of 5% cab be expected from this category.</dd>
</dl>

<p><em>Note</em>: The stock selection is also equally important for good returns. You cannot just invest in any small/mid cap and expect 25-30% return. It requires careful study of the company profile as well.</p>

<h2 id="portfolio-strategies">Portfolio Strategies</h2>
<p>Below are the strategies that we will follow for different risk profiles:</p>

<h3 id="low-risk">Low Risk</h3>
<p>60% of capital will be allocated in Fixed income instruments, 25% in Equity mutual funds, 10% in Equity stocks and 5% in Gold ETF’s.</p>

<p><em>Expected Return = (.60 x 9) + (.25 x 13) + (.10 x 19) + (.05 x 5) = 10.80%</em><br />
<strong>≈11%</strong></p>

<h3 id="medium-risk">Medium Risk</h3>
<p>40% of capital will be allocated in Fixed income instruments, 25% in Equity mutual funds, 30% in Equity stocks and 5% in Gold ETF’s.</p>

<p><em>Expected Return = (.40 x 9) + (.25 x 15) + (.30 x 21) + (.05 x 5) = 13.90%</em><br />
<strong>≈14%</strong></p>

<h3 id="high-risk">High Risk</h3>
<p>20% of capital will be allocated in Fixed income instruments, 25% in Equity mutual funds, 50% in Equity stocks and 5% in Gold ETF’s</p>

<p><em>Expected Return: (.20 x 9) + (.25 x 20) + (.50 x 28) + (.05 x 5) = 21.05%</em> <br />
<strong>≈22%</strong></p>
